\# 🏦 Loan Default Risk Prediction



This project uses Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. It includes a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to a deployed web interface.



\## 📊 Project Overview

\- \*\*Goal\*\*: Predict loan default status using financial and demographic data.

\- \*\*Model\*\*: Scikit-learn Pipeline (stored in `loan\_default\_pipeline.pkl`).

\- \*\*Interface\*\*: Built with Streamlit (`app.py`).



\## 📁 File Structure

\- `app.py`: The web application file.

\- `loan\_default\_risk\_model.py`: The main script for training and logic.

\- `Loan\_default\_dataset.csv`: The raw data used for the project.

\- `Reports \& Dashboards.pdf`: Detailed analysis and visualization of the results.

\- `requirements.txt`: List of necessary Python libraries.



\## 🚀 How to Run

1\. Install the dependencies:

&nbsp;  ```bash

&nbsp;  pip install -r requirements.txt
